# Pennsylvania Viral Suppression Integration

## Problem Statement

The JHEEM surveillance manager was missing comprehensive Pennsylvania HIV viral suppression data for 2022-2023, particularly the detailed demographic and transmission risk factor stratifications needed for modeling work. Previous integration attempts had failed due to data structure incompatibilities and incomplete stratification handling.

## Key Challenges Solved

1. **Multi-dimensional stratification preservation** - Raw CDC data contains 15 different stratification types (total, age-only, age+race+risk, etc.) that were being collapsed into single dimensions
2. **Location dimension expansion** - Manager needed to accept both PA state-level and county FIPS codes as new location values
3. **Data validation issues** - Standard validation methods (`pull()`) failed due to ontology mapping conflicts

## Deliverables

### Data Retrieval
- **`atlas_plus_viral_suppression_comprehensive.R`** - Pulls comprehensive PA viral suppression data from CDC Atlas Plus API
- **Output**: `data_raw/hiv_surveillance/viral_suppression_comprehensive_Pennsylvania_20250727_120208.csv` (18,820 records, 8,541 available)

### Data Integration  
- **`pa_viral_suppression_integration_corrected.R`** - Main integration script that successfully processes and integrates data
- **Features**:
  - Preserves all 15 stratification types with proper multi-dimensional relationships
  - Handles both state (PA) and county-level (FIPS codes) data
  - Maps 8,005 valid records across 12 successful stratifications
  - Uses direct access validation to bypass `pull()` method issues

### Supporting Files
- **`pa_viral_suppression_processing.R`** - Helper functions for data transformation (not used by main scripts)
- **`session_handoff_analysis_2025_08_10.md`** - Complete technical documentation of problem analysis and solution
- **`archive_pa_scripts/`** - Previous development iterations for reference

## Current Outputs

### Successfully Integrated Data
**File**: `cached/surveillance.manager_PA_corrected_20250810_115826.rdata`
- **Status**: Test copy with successfully integrated PA data
- **Contents**: 8,005 PA viral suppression records (2022-2023)
- **Coverage**: 
  - State-level: PA data across all stratifications
  - County-level: 42-65 PA counties depending on stratification
  - Stratifications: 12 of 15 types successfully integrated (3 had no valid data due to CDC suppression)

### Data Completeness
- **Total raw records**: 18,820
- **Available records**: 8,541 (CDC marked as available)
- **Integrated records**: 8,005 (valid data after quality filters)
- **Missing 536 records**: Marked "Available" but contain "Data suppressed" text values

### Manager Stratifications Created
âœ… Successful integrations:
- `year__location` (total: 131 records)
- `year__location__age` (age-only: 571 records)
- `year__location__race` (race-only: 526 records)
- `year__location__sex` (sex-only: 216 records)
- `year__location__risk` (transmission-only: 480 records)
- `year__location__age__race` (age+race: 1,434 records)
- `year__location__age__sex` (age+sex: 740 records)  
- `year__location__age__risk` (age+transmission: 1,434 records)
- `year__location__race__sex` (race+sex: 647 records)
- `year__location__race__risk` (race+transmission: 1,274 records)
- `year__location__sex__risk` (sex+transmission: 492 records)
- `year__location__age__race__risk` (age+race+transmission: 60 records)

## Next Steps for Production Use

1. **Apply integration to production manager**:
   ```r
   # Run the corrected integration script on production manager
   # This will update cached/surveillance.manager.rdata
   ```

2. **Future data updates**:
   - Use `atlas_plus_viral_suppression_comprehensive.R` to pull new years
   - Run `pa_viral_suppression_integration_corrected.R` to integrate

3. **Scaling to other states**:
   - Modify state parameter in data retrieval script
   - Integration script handles any state/county combination

## Technical Notes

- **Dependencies**: Requires `jheem2`, CDC Atlas Plus API access, and existing surveillance manager
- **Performance**: Processes ~8,000 records in under 30 seconds
- **Validation**: Uses direct array access instead of problematic `manager$pull()` method
- **Data quality**: Automatically filters invalid/suppressed values while preserving all valid CDC data
