# Age Analysis TO DO

- "Download" sex/race results - DONE
- Make sex/race plots for total (stacked area and median age timeline)
- Get numbers associated with Figure 2 stacked area - DONE ish (no CI for %)
- Include those numbers in the results section - DONE
- Write up a list of questions about the methods section for Melissa
- Bullet point introduction
- Make plot like Melissa's for PRCC
- Change the second state var plot to have delta general prop 55
- Fix typo in first state var plot name to "Prevalence 55+ in 2025"
- Use urbanicity metric as x-axis in another set
- 

To get numbers associated with Fig 2 stacked area, I refer to
    the "stacked_area_plot_data" in "plots_again.R".
But I don't have a CI for the percentage that each age group makes up.
