# LOG SUMMARY -----
# <calib.diagnosis.07.02.pk1-3> ----
# repeating calibration from yesterday with weight 1/8, running 3 parallel chains to see if they converge
# starting calibration from calib.diagnosis.07.01.pk1 

# <calib.diagnosis.07.01.pk1> ----
# w=1/8
# revised the prior for EL and LL sti screening multipliers
# change the diagnosis likelihood to use "autoregressive.1" correlation instead of compund symmetry
# >>> this one works great

# <calib.diagnosis.07.01.pk2> # downweighting likelihoods to w=1/32 to make sure it mixes well
# >>> this one didnt work as well

# <calib.diagnosis.06.30.pk1> ----
# changing the initial number infected in 1970
# adding new transmission multiplier in 1990
# calibrating to PS total, EL total, Late total, HIV tests
# only changing Transmission and Testing Parameters
# excluding sti.screening.multiplier.ps from calibration
# >>> The initial peak pre-1990 is gone. Simulations have a hard time catching up with EL diagnoses.
# >>> Manual try suggested high levels of screening for EL and LL is needed
