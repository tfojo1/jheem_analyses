##-- PART 1: Code Setup and Implementation                     --##
##---------------------------------------------------------------##
# Run the following code without making any changes

# Clone jheem2 repository from git (branch: shield_assignment_applicants). This repository contains the simulation engine and other necessary files.
# https://github.com/tfojo1/jheem2

# Clone jheem_analyses repository (branch: shield_assignment_applicants) from git to access the model specification and other necessary files.
# https://github.com/tfojo1/jheem_analyses

# On you local computer, within the jheem_analyses directory: Create a "cached" folder.
# This directory is not synced to git because of file sizes
# Use the following link to download required files:
# https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/5vxliw7fnq91kt0odbeab/AM5SrKajDnDVQ06M7Dmsem4?rlkey=i9rqo23thi9zg9ytav4u1lyha&dl=0
# Add the following datasets to this cached folder:
# surveillance.manager.rdata
# census.manager.rdata
# national.surveillance.Rdata
# google_mobility_data.Rdata

# Pull both repositories to make sure you have the most recent version

# Navigate to the jheem_analyses directory (setwd) and run the following code to install the required packages and set up the model specification.
# You may be prompted to install additional packages that are dependencies for these packages as well.
# source('../jheem_analyses/first_time_setup/install_packages.R')

# Once all packages are installed, the model is ready for use.

###############
# Set up the model specification by running the following (this may take a few moments)
source('../jheem_analyses/applications/EHE/ehe_specification.R')

# Create the model engine for a given location (c.12580 is the code for Baltimore City) (this may take a few moments)
engine = create.jheem.engine(version = 'ehe', location = 'c.12580', end.year=2025, max.run.time.seconds = 10)

# Load a set of parameters (set at default values)
params = suppressWarnings(get.medians(EHE.PARAMETERS.PRIOR))

# Set the global transmission rate to equal 0.01
params['global.trate'] = 0.01

# Using the model engine, run and save a single simulation using the transmission rate you loaded above (this may take a few moments)
sim = engine$run(parameters = params)

# Visualize and describe the simulation fit for projected "new HIV diagnosis" and "prevalence of diagnosed HIV" against CDC's reported data:
# 1. New diagnoses
simplot(sim, outcomes = "new", dimension.values = list(year = 2007:2025))

# 2. Diagnosed prevalence
simplot(sim, outcomes = "diagnosed.prevalence", dimension.values = list(year = 2007:2025))

##-- Part 2: Code Implementation and Analysis                      --##
##-------------------------------------------------------------------##
# In Part 1, you set the global transmission rate (global.trate) to a fixed value
# and observed its impact on the simulation outcomes. Now, we will explore the effect of variability in this parameter

## Tasks:
# Set the R seed to 1234
# Instead of fixing the global transmission rate, you will investigate how changes in this rate affect the model's predictions.
# Extract the calibration targets for number of new diagnosis (new.diagnosis) and prevalence of diagnosed HIV (diagnosed.prevalence) as follow:
new.diagnosis.target=SURVEILLANCE.MANAGER$pull(outcome="diagnoses", location="C.12580",source="cdc.aggregated.county")
diagnosed.prevalence.target= SURVEILLANCE.MANAGER$pull(outcome="diagnosed.prevalence", location="C.12580",source="cdc.aggregated.county")

# Extract the simulated values for each output over specific years from the sim object as follow:
new.diagnoses.sim=sim$get("new",year=c(2008:2021))
diagnosed.prevalence.sim=sim$get("diagnosed.prevalence",year=c(2008:2021))

# Write a code to find the global.trate that provides the best fit to new.diagnosis.target and diagnosed.prevalence.target over time
# you can use alternative measures of goodness of fit that you deem appropriate
# Visualize the outcomes of these simulations, focusing on the "new HIV diagnoses" and # "prevalence of diagnosed HIV" from 2007 to 2025.
# please provide comments throughout your code to describe your rationale and include a summary at the end to describe the results

# hint:
# Sample  different values of global.trate from a uniform distribution bounded between 0 and 0.1.
# For each sampled value, update the params object, run the simulation, and compute goodness of fit
# You can use the simplot function to plot outputs from several simulations on the same plot:
# simplot(sim1, sim2, outcomes = "new", dimension.values = list(year = 2007:2025))

##-- Part 3: Data Extraction and Analysis                                                                    --##

# In this section, you'll explore and analyze simulation results related to new HIV diagnoses.
# You will need to extract, filter, and aggregate data from a simulation object and visualize your findings.

# Task 1: Extract the Number of New Diagnoses
# First, we need to extract the number of new diagnoses from the sim object created in Part 1.
# you can call this object new.diagnoses
# If you donâ€™t have access to the sim object, you would load it from the onedrive folder.

## Describe the dimensions and names of the dimensions of the Extracted Objects

## Filter Objects for Specific Subgroups
# a. Filter the new.diagnoses to focus on the subgroup: 13-24 years old, Black, MSM, and never IDU.
# b. Plot the filtered data over time
# c. interpret the trend in new diagnoses for this subgroup
# hint: you can filter data by accessing specific indexes in each dimension
# new_filtered <- new[location_index, year_index, age_index, race_index, sex_index, risk_index,
#                     ,    # All simulations (if you want to keep all simulations, leave empty or specify indices)
#                     drop = FALSE]


## Draw a histogram of the age distribution for new HIV diagnoses in the year 2020
## what proportion of new diagnosis in year 2020 occurred among 12-24 years old?
# hint: you can aggregate the new.diagnoses across all groups in year 2020 and plot the age distribution using ggplot2

# Please review the following paper and answer the below questions:
# "What Will It Take to End HIV in the United States? A Comprehensive, Local-Level Modeling Study"
# https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M21-1501
# you can also find a saved copy under the cashed folder: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/5vxliw7fnq91kt0odbeab/AM5SrKajDnDVQ06M7Dmsem4?rlkey=i9rqo23thi9zg9ytav4u1lyha&dl=0
# under fojo-et-al-2021-what-will-it-take-to-end-hiv-in-the-united-states.pdf

# 1.	What is the benefit of running 1000 simulations for each MSA? how would you determine if 1000 simulation is appropriate or if you need less/more?

# 2.	The authors assumed that, without any additional intervention, PrEP coverage would continue its trajectory into the future.
#     Consider a scenario where baseline PrEP coverage remains fixed at 2023's level.
#     How might that change the impact of the modeled PrEP intervention to 2030?

# 3.	The authors chose to scale up the interventions linearly. How might this differ in a real-world scenario?

# 4.	Provide an interpretation of Figure 3, panel D.

# 5.  The compartmental model is deterministic by nature. What are the sources of uncertainty in the current JHEEM model
#     that contribute to shaded areas in Figure 3?

# 6.	The model calibration focuses on 10 calibration target including new diagnoses, prevalence,etc. Let's assume that we have more certainty
#     in some targets than others. How can we reflect this in the likelihood function used for calibration?
